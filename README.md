# Overview

Contains web client and modules for ML job manager platform.
Source codes for platform infrastructure with the web client and integrated modules are in this [repository](https://github.com/bursasha/ml-job-manager).

ML job manager is a platform designed for analyzing astronomical data using maching learning algorithms. Replaces the outdated platform [VO-CLOUD](https://github.com/vodev).

Client and modules were implemented as a part of my bachelor thesis (Science platform for machine learning of big astronomical data - data analysis modules, 2025) at Faculty of Information Technology CVUT.

For more information about client and modules read README in corresponding folder.
