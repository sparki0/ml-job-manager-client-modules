# Machine learning modules

Machine learning modules for analyzing spectral spectra.

# Overview

Contains following modules:

- **Active learning** - trains and applies CNN for spectra classfication.
- **Preprocessing** - transforms and scales spectra.
- **Dimensionality reduction** - visualize high-dimensional data in 2D using t-SNE.

This modules works with LAMOST DR2 spectra, if you want to use another spectra from other sources. You need to update preprocessing module, namely reading raw data from the file.

In active learning module CNN developed by Ing. Ond≈ôej Podsztavek is used.
